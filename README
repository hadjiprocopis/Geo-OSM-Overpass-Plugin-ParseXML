NAME

    Geo::OSM::Overpass::Plugin::ParseXML - Plugin for Geo::OSM::Overpass to
    fetch bus stop data in given area

VERSION

    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    This is a plugin for Geo::OSM::Overpass, which is a module to fetch
    data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Project using Overpass API. It
    fetches information about an OSM element given element id and element
    type.

    In order to use this plugin, first create a Geo::OSM::Overpass object
    to do the communication with the Overpass API server. Secondly, create
    the plugin object and run its gorun() method. (note: no bounding box is
    required)

        use Geo::OSM::Overpass;
        use Geo::OSM::Overpass::Plugin::ParseXML;
        use Data::Dumper;
    
        my $eng = Geo::OSM::Overpass->new();
        die unless defined $eng;
        my $plug = Geo::OSM::Overpass::Plugin::ParseXML->new({
            'engine' => $eng
        });
        die unless defined $plug;
        my $perlstruct = $plug->gorun({'input-string'=><<'EOXML'}) or die;
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <osm version="0.6" generator="Overpass API 0.7.55.7 8b86ff77">
    <note>The data included in this document is from www.openstreetmap.org.
    The data is made available under ODbL.</note>
    <meta osm_base="2019-05-15T22:24:03Z"/>
    
      <node id="37559112" lat="35.1759320" lon="33.3745372">
        <tag k="highway" v="traffic_signals"/>
      </node>

    </osm> EOXML

        # or run a query first, e.g. FetchTrafficSignals and then
        # just call $plug->gorun() (with no parameters) to process those results.
        # anyway, with our minimal example ...
        print Dumper($perlstruct);

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 new({'engine' => $eng})

    Constructor. A hashref of parameters contains the only required
    parameter which is an already created Geo::OSM::Overpass object. If in
    your plugin have no use for this, then call it like
    new({'engine'=undef})>

 gorun(...)

    It will convert OSM XML results to a Perl hashtable. The XML to be
    converted can either be from the optional hashref parameter
    input-string or input-filename or as a last resort from the last query
    results of the engine. One of these must be specified. If you go with
    the engine then make sure that a query has been executed and it was
    successful and last_query_result() returns a defined value, i.e. a
    reference to the string holding the results.

    It will return the Perl hashtable produced on success or undef on
    failure.
